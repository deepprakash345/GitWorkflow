# Rules

Adaptive Form allows changing the properties of a field dynamically using JSON Formula expressions.

TODO: add link to JSON Formula

Every field has a rules property which is an object where the key is the name of the property with the value as a
valid JSON Formula expression that gets computed dynamically whenever the value of the fields used in the expression
change.

For example, the below JSON will produce two fields `fieldA` and `fieldB` and whenver a user enters the value in
`fieldA`, the value of `fieldB` will become its square
```json
{
"items": [
    {
      "name" : "fieldA"
      "type" : "number"
    },
    {
      "name" :"fieldB",
      "rules" : {
         "value" : "fieldA*fieldA"
      }
    }
]
}
```
