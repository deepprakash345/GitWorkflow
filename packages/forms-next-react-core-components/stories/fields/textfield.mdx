# Text Field

A Text Field is a component to capture a text that user can enter using keyboard.

One can provide a
[label](https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/livecycle/af2-docs/spec/latest/index.html#field-properties-label),
[help text](https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/livecycle/af2-docs/spec/latest/index.html#field-properties-description)
and
[placeholder](https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/livecycle/af2-docs/spec/latest/index.html#field-properties-placeholder)
that can be displayed to the user to aid them in filling the data in the fields.
It also supports entering multiple formats including date and numbers using the
[type](https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/livecycle/af2-docs/spec/latest/index.html#field-constraints-type)
and
[format](https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/livecycle/af2-docs/spec/latest/index.html#field-constraints-format)
constraints.

## With Rich Text Caption

The captions can contain html text as well. For <strong>html text</strong> we use sanitize-html
package with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-html#default-options"> default options</a>

```
{
  "fieldType" : "text-input",
  "label" : {
     ....,
     "richText" : true
  }
}
```

{

  ...
  "placeholder" : "..."
}
```

## Different Data Types

The Text Field can coerce the value into different data types using the `type` property. It allows capturing data in
number, string, boolean types and date format.

```json
{
  "fieldType": "text-input",
  "type" : "..."
}
```

### For Capturing Numbers

```json
{
  "fieldType": "text-input",
  "type" : "number"
}
```

<Story id="adaptive-form-components-text-input-field--type-number" />

We also support a number widget which allows entering only numbers.

#### Using the number widget

```json
{
  "fieldType": "number-input"
}
```

<Story id="adaptive-form-components-text-input-field--number-widget" />

When using a specialized widget for entering numbers, type property is not required. One can although set the property
to string as well and the numbers will be saved as string

### For Capturing Date

```json
{
  "fieldType": "text-input",
  "type" : "string",
  "format" : "date"
}
```

<Story id="adaptive-form-components-text-input-field--type-date" />

A special widget for providing date input also exists in the implementation.

#### Using the date widget

```json
{
  "fieldType": "date-input"
}
```

<Story id="adaptive-form-components-text-input-field--date-widget" />

## Capturing multi line data

To capture multi line input, the spec provides a special fieldType `multiline-input`.

```json
{
  "fieldType": "multiline-input"
}
```
