# Events

Apart from rules, one can handle events in the Form Definition to provide dynamic behaviour to the Form. The Spec
supports a number of [events](https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/livecycle/af2-docs/spec/latest/#_events) that allow
adding additional capabilities in the Form.

## onChange Event


<Story id="adaptive-form-events--change" />

## onBlur Event

<Story id="adaptive-form-events--blur" />

## onInitialize Event

<Story id="adaptive-form-events--initialize" />

## onClick Event

<Story id="adaptive-form-events--click" />

# Custom Events
Apart from out of the box events, the Form Definition allows dispatching a
[custom event](https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/livecycle/af2-docs/spec/latest/#_custom_events) to a field and changing
its property.

## Dispatch Event
For instance one can set the value of a field to the number of times a button has been clicked

<Story id="adaptive-form-events-custom-events--dispatch" />

## Dispatch Event with payload
Apart from that custom events can also pass an extra payload

<Story id="adaptive-form-events-custom-events--dispatch-with-payload" />

## Fetch data from APIs
<Story id="adaptive-form-events-custom-events--fetch-data" />
