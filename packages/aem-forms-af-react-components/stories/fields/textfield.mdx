# Text Field

A Text Field is a component to capture a text that user can enter using keyboard.

One can provide a
label,
help text
and
placeholder
that can be displayed to the user to aid them in filling the data in the fields.
It also supports entering multiple formats including date and numbers using the
type
and
format
constraints.

```json
{
 "fieldType" : "text-input",
 "label" : {
     "value" : "...."
  },
  "name" : "field1"
}
```

## With Rich Text Label

The captions can contain html text as well. For <strong>html text</strong> we use sanitize-html
package with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-html#default-options"> default options</a>

```
{
  "fieldType" : "text-input",
  "label" : {
     ....,
     "richText" : true
  }
}
```

## With Placeholder

```
{
  "fieldType" : "text-input",
  ...
  "placeholder" : "..."
}
```

# Different Data Types

The Text Field can coerce the value into different data types using the `type` property. It allows capturing data in
number, string, boolean types and date format.

```json
{
  "fieldType": "text-input",
  "type" : "..."
}
```

## Number Input

```json
{
  "fieldType": "text-input",
  "type" : "number"
}
```

<Story id="adaptive-form-components-text-input-field--type-number" />

We also support a number widget which allows entering only numbers.

When using a specialized widget for entering numbers, type property is not required. One can although set the property
to string as well and the numbers will be saved as string

## Date Input

```json
{
  "fieldType": "text-input",
  "type" : "string",
  "format" : "date"
}
```

<Story id="adaptive-form-components-text-input-field--type-date" />

## Capturing multi line data

To capture multi line input, the spec provides a special fieldType `multiline-input`.

```json
{
  "fieldType": "multiline-input"
}
```
