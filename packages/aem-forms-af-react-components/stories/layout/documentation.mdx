# Form Layouts

Out of the Box the specification does not support any layouts. But when the form is rendered on the screen a layout is required.
Adaptive Form Super Component provides the layout functionality using custom View Types and custom Property that

The layouts are supported only for fieldTypes that are Panels.

```json
{
  "fieldType": "panel",
  "name" : "panel1",
  "items" : []
}
```

## Stacked

By default the elements in a panel are stacked from top to bottom

```
{
"fieldType": "panel",
"name" : "panel1",
"items" : [{...}, {...}, {...}]
}
```
